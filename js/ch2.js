                    The seagulls seem to enjoy themselves. They make big circles in the 
                    air followed by sharp drops into the sea to catch small fish. They go 
                    with the flow and navigate the sea winds effortlessly. The small ones

                    aerial manoeuvres. The big ones have large wings and orange beaks; 
                    they glide high up in the air supervising the entire shore. The 
                    seagulls' activity makes an impression on you.
