                    very comfortably doing...
                    The music starts playing and people cheer up. The song sounds
                    good! It is an old one from the 70's. It's about this
                    important human emotion being in the air.
                    The camera is turned on and you are now supposed to start
                    dancing.
                    Andrenaline rushes through your body, and you start moving
                    on the music. Very much to your
                    surprize you make it! It is a different style of music than
                    what you have been dancing to until now, but it has a similar
                    musical pattern underneath. The steps you know work well on
                    it because the song has enough dynamic and energy!
                    It becomes super fun, and you have a great time during and
                    after
                    the rehearsal! Something you would definitely
                    remember...
